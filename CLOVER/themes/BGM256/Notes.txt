A theme by blackosx.

- The device icons in the /icons folder with .icns extensions are all .png files.
- All image files have been converted to 8-bit optimised images using https://tinypng.com. Using this rather than pnquant due to an issue with picopng in Clover failing to decode the PNG image with multiple IDAT chunks.
